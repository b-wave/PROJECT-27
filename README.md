# PROJECT-27
Which was a Telemetering transmitter from the 1964 era book 103 Simple Transistor Projects, by Tom Knitel  I grew up with this book.  This was one of my bucket-list projects. Although I am not exactly sure how I planned to send this device aloft.  I do remember trying to build it up with a CB radio crystal and a few random transistors ( it never oscillated) and some vague idea of helium baloons in a laundry bag! Informaton is not ransmitted digitally from this device either.  The RF is AM modulated and the frequency of the modulation is controlled by a thermistor.  Of course, this would need to be calibrated.

103 Projects!

I created two versions, MKI and MKIII are functional. The MK1 is pretty much a copy of the original version. The Mk3 may actully be legal to operate as a telemetering device on the current 27MHz band.    MK3 is a modern version that also features the same simple Tempature (Tempature-to-Frequency converter) and it also now includes an altitude channel (Pulse modulated) and even a bright LED beacon.  ( based on Project #25) 

These files are "modern" versions of the 103 Simple Transistor Projects Book.   Basically, the first version was a simple crystal oscillator and a multivibrator circuit - just like teh original.  The crystal was taken from a toy "27MHZ" remote controller.  It turns out the frequency is in the ISM telemetry part ofm that band.  The original project goes into detail about the FCC requirements, in force in 1964.  He even recommends the transmitter is inspected by a certified technitian to comply with the then requirements.  I did a quick search and found the mentioned sections are not even in existance.  I did see the differences are that more power is allowed than originally allowed - but - there is now a limit now on the length of time a "tone" can be transmitted.  The original and MK1 transmit continiously so they would not be legal. But of course, not FCC type accepted for manufacture but for experimantal purposes on the ISM band it should be OK.

Modern version MK1

That's why the a Mk2 and Mk3 versions.  These attempt to limit the time that the tone is transmitted and clean up the output to hopefully comply with the rules.  The circuit was implemented as another two transistor multivibrator.  I also added a high effecency LED that produces a bright strobe beacon as well so it can be tracked and possibly located.  Since the strobes timing was arbitrarily set i relized that that could be, in fact, controlled and a second channel of information could be transmitted by this pulse length.  I constructed a 1960's technology version of an altimeter that is a simple sealed tube of air withe a plunger attached to a slide potentiometer. I will add details of this device later. ( Mk2 was a never completed high(er) power version)

Modern version MK3 (top)

The original was intended to powered by 1.5V AA cell.  Three volts would actully be OK for FCC power output requirements. I think a modern LiPo would probabiy survive the tempuature extreme cold a baloon borne sonde would encounter. There is plenty of room for two cells as shown on the botom view. Of course weight is a prime consideration for baloon payloads as well.
