# PROJECT-27
Which was a Telemetering transmitter.  I created two versions, MKI and MKIII which may actully be leagal to operate as a telemetering device on the 27MHz band.  MK1 is pretty much a copy of the original version.  MK3 is a modern version that features an LRD beacon, Tempuature (Tempuature-to-Frequency converter) and altitude (Pulse modulated).  

These files are "modern" versions of the 103 Simple Transistor Projects Book.
