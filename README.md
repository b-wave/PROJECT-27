# PROJECT-27
Which was a Telemetering transmitter from the 1964 era book 103 Simple Transistor Projects, by Tom Knitel  I grew up with this book.  This was one of my bucket-list projects. Although I am not exactly sure how I planned to send this device aloft.  I do remember trying to build it up with a CB radio crystal and a few random transistors ( it never oscillated) and some vague idea of helium baloons in a laundry bag!

103 Projects!

I created two versions, MKI and MKIII which may actully be leagal to operate as a telemetering device on the 27MHz band.  MK1 is pretty much a copy of the original version.  MK3 is a modern version that features the same simple Tempuature (Tempuature-to-Frequency converter) and now includes an altitude channel (Pulse modulated) and even a bright LED beacon.  ( based on Project #25) 

These files are "modern" versions of the 103 Simple Transistor Projects Book.

THe original was intended to powered by 1.5V AA cell.  Three volts would actully be OK for FCC power output requirements. I think a modern LiPo would probabiy survive the tempuature extreme cold a baloon borne sonde would encounter.
