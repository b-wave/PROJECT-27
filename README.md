103 Projects!

I created two versions, MKI and MKIII which may actully be leagal to operate as a telemetering device on the 27MHz band.  MK1 is pretty much a copy of the original version.  MK3 is a modern version that features an LRD beacon, Tempuature (Tempuature-to-Frequency converter) and altitude (Pulse modulated).  

These files are "modern" versions of the 103 Simple Transistor Projects Book.

THe original was intended to powered by 1.5V AA cell.  Three volts would actully be OK for FCC power output requirements. I think a modern LiPo would probabiy survive the tempuature extreme cold a baloon borne sonde would encounter.
